We have two codes for Matrix Multiplication . 

The first one is Naive Matrix multipplication which incorporates simple algorithm to multiply two matrices and order of this algorithm is O(N^3)

The other one is optimized matrix multiplication which optimizes matrix multiplication with two techniques ...one is Copy optimization and other one is Blocking . 

To run Naive Matrix Multiplication ...one simply has to mention the target as mentioned below 

////TARGET = naive

To run optimized Matrix multiplication one has to change target as mentioned below 

////TARGET = optimized

Plese remember to given Arguments to main while executing the program.

While executing the likwid Script ....we have to make sure that ....the following line is mentioned properly ...

ROGRAM="naive 2048x2048-1 2048x2048-2 C.out" for naive ....Default is set to Naive ...

for changing to optimized code just change name "naive" to "optimized"
